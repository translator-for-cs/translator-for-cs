Course specific prerequisites
No strict requirements. However, the lectures and tutorials assume the student has 1) knowledge corresponding to a course in algorithms and data structures, 2) programming skills in an imperative high-level language (e.g., C, C++ or Java), and 3) some understanding of vector analysis in three dimensions (the dot product, cross product, and matrix multiplication). Typically, the student has successfully completed an education comparable with a bachelor degree within Computer Science or equivalent.

Aim
The course aims to provide broad knowledge about algorithms for three dimensional computer graphics and also gives the student experience in implementing basic 3D graphic techniques.

Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)
Describe the fundamental algorithms and processes used to create computer graphics in 3D-games and movies.
Utilize the functionality of dedicated hardware support for graphics through programming interfaces.
Implement efficient algorithms to generate 2-dimensional images from 3-dimensional models.
Implement algorithms to generate real-time renderings and photo realistic renderings.

Content
The course provides knowledge of the principles used to create images through computer algorithms. The primary focus is on real-time rendering and photo realistic rendering.

The first part of the course covers real-time rendering, and techniques for e.g. illumination, special effects, shadows and reflections will be studied. Design of graphics hardware and speedup algorithms will also be treated.

The second part focuses on generating photo-realistic images and includes studying of ray tracing and global illumination. In addition, the corresponding mathematics will be revealed.

Organisation
The course is organized into lectures and exercises. The exercises focus on implementing 3D graphics algorithms using C, C++ or possibly Java.
