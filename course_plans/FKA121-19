Course specific prerequisites

Basic programming knowledge and experience, preferably in C. Basic undergraduate physics.

Aim

The aim of the course is to refine computational skills by providing direct experience in using a computer to solve problems in physics. Numerical techniques are introduced and applied in a broad spectrum of various physical problems. The course is designed to develop an understanding of modeling physical systems using different numerical techniques.

Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)
use C to solve numerical problems.

explain and numerically apply the basic idea behind the molecular dynamics simulation method.

explain how random numbers can be used to treat static and dynamic phenomena and numerically apply the methodology.

explain and numerically apply the Metropolis Monte Carlo method.

integrate knowledge in modeling physical systems with various numerical techniques.

write well-structured technical reports where computational results are presented and explained.

communicate results and conclusions in a clear way.

Content
the programming language C

ordinary differential equations, molecular dynamics simulation

random numbers, random processes, Brownian dynamics

discrete and fast Fourier transforms, power spectrum analysis

Monte Carlo integration and the Metropolis algorithm

Variational and diffusion Monte Carlo

Organisation

The different numerical techniques and the physical problems are presented in a series of lectures. The most important part in the course is the students own activity in applying the methods and solving a set of exercises and homework assignments. Scheduled computer laboratory sessions are provided, with instructors available for consultation. The programming language C is being used in the course.
