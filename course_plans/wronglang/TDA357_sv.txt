            Kursspecifika förkunskaper
	To be eligible for the course the student should have successfully completed university level courses of at least 45 credits, including:at least 15 credits in programming, e.g., TDA548, TDA552, TDA367, or equivalent,at least 7.5 credits in mathematics or mathematic reasoning,concepts in logic, sets, functions and relations that could be acquired with, e.g., TMV200
	
                Syfte
	Databases are a ubiquitous feature of the information technology society, and most people have come in contact with them, either directly while using the world wide web, or indirectly through banks, the tax office, etc. A course on database systems is therefore essential to a well-rounded education in computer science.
	
    
            Lärandemål (efter fullgjord kurs ska studenten kunna)
	On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:Knowledge and understandingexplain the semantic meaning of queries using relational algebradescribe the effects of transactions and indexes in a relational databaseCompetence and skillsconstruct an Entity-Relationship diagram for a given domaintranslate an Entity-Relationship diagram into a relational database schemaapply design theory concepts for relational databases such as functional dependencies and normalizationretrieve and modify data using a database language for respective taskdesign a database interface using constraints, views, triggers and privilegesimplement a relational database schema and related interface using a data definition languagecommunicate with a database, through a database interface, from a software applicationJudgement and approachevaluate and create different models for a database domain using EntityRelationship diagrams and relational schemascontrast different data models, such as the relational and the semi-structured data models
	
                Innehåll
	The course covers the basic principles of database systems as seen by users, application programmers and database administrators. A laboratory assignment develops these topics as a running example throughout the course. These include programming in SQL, as seen by a user querying or modifying an existing database, by a database designer, and by an application programmer invoking SQL from a host language.Course contents include:entity-relationship modelingfunctional dependencies and normalisationdatabase querying and manipulation through SQLinterfacing to a database from a host language (such as Java/JDBC)overview of XML and other non-SQL models
        	  
                Organisation
	The course consists of weekly lectures and exercise sessions, as well as supervised lab sessions. 
	
                Litteratur
	            Course literature to be announced the latest 8 weeks prior to the start of the course.
		
                       Examination inklusive obligatoriska moment
       	Written individual exam given in an examination hall and programming assignments. The programming assignments are normally carried out in pairs.
