Eligibility
General entry requirements for bachelor's level (first cycle)
Specific entry requirements
The same as for the programme that owns the course.
Aim
Computer programming is a basic skill needed in both studies and professional life.
This course gives the basic skills that the participants can both accomplish programming tasks typical of science and engineering tasks and understand the fundamental principles of computers and programming.

Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)
Knowledge and understanding
Express mathematical formulas as programming language expressions and algorithms
Choose appropriate datatypes and datastructures for different kinds of data
Structure large programs into manageable and reusable units by the use of concepts such as modules, classes, and functions
Search and find relevant program libraries and use them in adequate ways
Explain the relations between hardware, operating system, and user programs
Use programming for basic data analysis involving large files

Competence and skills
Write programs that manipulate numeric and textual data to perform standard programming tasks
Build interactive programs with both text-based and graphical user interfaces
Make programs that read, transform, and generate files in the file system
Use standard libraries and follow best programming practices
Test programs by methods such as unit, regression, and property-based testing
Use programming tools such as code editors and revision control systems

Judgement and approach
Assess the difficulty and resources needed for typical programming tasks
Analyse code written by others and find errors and possibilities for improvement
Content
The course is a first introduction to programming by using a general-purpose programming language.
It gives a comprehensive knowledge of the language, enabling the student to write code for a wide variety of tasks and to read and reuse code written by other programmers.
In parallel to learning the language, the student will be introduced to the basic concepts of computers and programming.
These concepts include:
Datatypes and their binary representations in the computer
The relation between source code, compiler, and the machine
The syntactic structure of expressions, statements, functions, classes, modules, etc
The basics of algorithmic design by the use of iteration, recursion, decomposition to functions, and top-down vs. bottom-up
The basics of software design in terms of functions, classes, modules, etc
Organisation
The course consists of lectures and exercise sessions.
There is also a number of programming assignments where the skills can be trained in practice
Literature
Information about literature will be given on the course home-page before the start of the course
Examination including compulsory elements
Both modules include mandatory programming assignments.
Course grade is based on a written exam, provided all mandatory assignments have been passed.
